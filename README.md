# Zero-Shot Bowel Segmentation in MRE

This repository documents an ongoing research project on **zero-shot bowel segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE)** using foundation models.

This work was presented as a **poster at KMMS 2025 (Korea Multimedia Society)**, where we reported a systematic baseline analysis of zero-shot segmentation performance on clinical MRE data.

Due to the project being part of an active research collaboration, **source code and datasets are not publicly released** at this time.

## Research Focus

The primary goal of this project is to **analyze the behavior and limitations of foundation models** when applied to bowel segmentation in MRE images under a **zero-shot setting**, without task-specific fine-tuning.

In particular, the study focuses on:
- Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of baseline segmentation performance
- Failure case analysis related to voxel spacing and acquisition variability
- Identifying practical challenges in applying pretrained segmentation models to MRE data
