# Zero-Shot Bowel Segmentation in MRE

This repository documents an ongoing research project on zero-shot bowel segmentation in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE).

The work was presented as a poster at **KMMS 2025 (Korean Society of Medical and Molecular Imaging)**.

Due to the project being part of an active research collaboration, source code and datasets are not publicly released.

## Research Focus

The goal of this project is to investigate whether foundation models can perform bowel segmentation on MRE images in a zero-shot setting, without task-specific fine-tuning.
